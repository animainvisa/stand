This was a project that never went live and as such I'm allowed to put up the code online. If you ask me why, the client changed his mind later on when I was almost done with the website.

This was going to be a website for a car sales company. I made it live here http://tvt5.byethost7.com/

I coded everything myself in this one.

You can see on the left where it says "Pesquisa" it stands for "Search" where you can look up for any cars available.
"Marca" stands for "Make" and "Modelo" for "Model" and they will update automatically as you select an option or more cars are added to the database. 
In the middle you can see "Destaque" which stands for "Car of the Day" type of thing.
To the right, you find the latest entries.

You can go to http://tvt5.byethost7.com/vehicles.php for the complete listing of cars.

You can find the admin page on http://tvt5.byethost7.com/admin/, the password is "teste".

Where it says "Destaque ID" is the car you want to highlight in the front page. You type in the car id and click on "Actualizar" to make it happen.

Below, you have a list of all cars submitted. You can edit them, and also upload more pictures (I've used the InnoDB engine to store the images in the database) choosing which picture should be the default one. When editing a car entry you can go back to the main admin page by clicking on the link "Terminar" to the right side of the page. To remove any car you just have to click on the X.
To add a new car you just have to click on the link "Adicionar Veiculo" to the right side of the admin page.

There's also an option to email your friends a car you liked.
